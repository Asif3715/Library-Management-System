Library Management System:
This program operates by leveraging a collection of classes designed to perform various functions. Its core functionality revolves around interacting with a MySQL database, which serves as the repository for both book and user data. The database structure comprises a "student" database housing two tables: 'user' and 'book'. Through the utilization of basic SQL queries, the Java program facilitates the manipulation and presentation of data stored within this database. This database resides locally on a server and is accessed locally within the program. The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) framework facilitates the connection between the Java program and the MySQL database. The primary package responsible for managing queries and database connections is java.sql .
